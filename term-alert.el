;; Notifications when commands complete in term.el.
;;
;; Usage
;;
;; Suppose you start a command in the terminal emulator, but it's
;; taking much longer than expected.  You want to go and do other
;; things, but don't want to have to keep checking the terminal buffer
;; to see if that command has finished.  So you use term-alert:
;;
;; 1. In the terminal buffer, run `term-alert-next-command-toggle'.
;; 2. When the running command finishes, a notification pops up to
;;    tell you.
;;
;; If you want to get notifications for all commands in a buffer (not
;; just the current/next one), run `term-alert-all-toggle', and all
;; commands will generate alerts until you explicitly turn it off.
;;
;; Because it's entirely inside Emacs, you don't need to stop the
;; command to enable an alert on it (an advantage over 'alert' shell
;; commands, which usually require you to pause the command and
;; restart it).  And because it uses term-cmd
;; (https://github.com/calliecameron/term-cmd), you can alert commands
;; running in tmux or over SSH, too (as long as the remote shell is
;; set up correctly).
;;
;; Set up keybindings:
;;
;;     ;; I'm on a UK keyboard, where # and ' are next to Enter
;;     (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-#") 'term-alert-next-command-toggle)
;;     (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "M-#") 'term-alert-all-toggle)
;;     (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-'") 'term-alert-runtime)
;;
;; You can change what happens when an alert occurs by setting the
;; variable `term-alert-function'.
;;
;;
;; Installation
;;
;; Install the term-alert package from MELPA.
;;
;; Set up your shell; in zsh you also get timing information in
;; notifications.
;;
;; - zsh: 'source ~/.emacs.d/term-alert/setup.zsh'
;; - bash: 'source ~/.emacs.d/term-alert/setup.bash'
;;
;; (Replace ~/.emacs.d with wherever your `user-emacs-directory' is.)

completed command in the terminal. (Note that this requires
cooperation from the shell process; see the readme for this package.)
