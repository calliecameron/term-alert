Notifications when commands complete in term.el.

## Usage

Suppose you start a command in the terminal emulator, but it's taking much
longer than expected. You want to go and do other things, but don't want to have
to keep checking the terminal buffer to see if that command has finished. So you
use term-alert:

1. In the terminal buffer, run `term-alert-next-command-toggle`.
2. When the running command finishes, a notification pops up to tell you.

If you want to get notifications for all commands in a buffer (not just the
current/next one), run `term-alert-all-toggle`, and all commands will generate
alerts until you explicitly turn it off.

Because it's entirely inside Emacs, you don't need to stop the command to enable
an alert on it (an advantage over `alert` shell commands, which usually require
you to pause the command and restart it). And because it uses
[term-cmd](https://github.com/calliecameron/term-cmd), you can alert commands
running in tmux or over SSH, too (as long as the remote shell is set up
correctly).

Set up keybindings:

```elisp
;; I'm on a UK keyboard, where # and ' are next to Enter
(define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-#") 'term-alert-next-command-toggle)
(define-key term-raw-map (kbd "M-#") 'term-alert-all-toggle)
(define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-'") 'term-alert-runtime)
```

You can change what happens when an alert occurs by setting the variable
`term-alert-function`.

## Installation

Install the `term-alert` package from MELPA.

Set up your shell; in zsh you also get timing information in notifications.

- zsh: `source ~/.emacs.d/term-alert/setup.zsh`
- bash: `source ~/.emacs.d/term-alert/setup.bash`

(Replace ~/.emacs.d with wherever your `user-emacs-directory` is.)
